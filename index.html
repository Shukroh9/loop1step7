It seems like people are just looking for someone to show them the slightest amount of attention, settling for something much less than respect. I am convinced one of the best ways to help any relationship grow is by showing respect.</p>
                    <p>I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be respected. What is respect?Respect is showing someone extra special attention, or high regard, based on  a desire to show them how highly they are valued.</p>
